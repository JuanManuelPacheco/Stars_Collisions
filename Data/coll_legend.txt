4Myr:

	2 stars, both 4 Myr old. The primary is the same as in 
	Ballone et al. (2022), the secondary is the same, but 2 
	Myr older. Radial orbit.

Renzo:
	
	2 stars, same profiles as in Renzo et al. (2021). Radial
	orbit.

Halfres:
	
	Same 2 stars as in Ballone et al. (2022). Radial orbit
	with velocity at infinity = 10 km/s, with half of the SPH
        particles.

b0.1:

	Same 2 stars as in Ballone et al. (2022). Non radial
	orbit with periastron distance b = 0.1 Rsun.

b1:

	Same 2 stars as in Ballone et al. (2022). Non radial
	orbit with periastron distance b = 1 Rsun.

b3:

	Same 2 stars as in Ballone et al. (2022). Non radial
	orbit with periastron distance b = 3 Rsun.

v10:

	Same 2 stars as in Ballone et al. (2022). Radial orbit
	with velocity at infinity = 10 km/s


v100:

	Same 2 stars as in Ballone et al. (2022). Radial orbit
	with velocity at infinity = 100 km/s

v500:

	Same 2 stars as in Ballone et al. (2022). Radial orbit
	with velocity at infinity = 500 km/s
